in summary: a URI identifies, a URL identifies and locates.
Consider a specific edition of Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet, of which you have a digital copy on your home network.
You could identify the text as urn:isbn:0-486-27557-4.
That would be a URI, but more specifically a URN because it names the text.
You could also identify the text as file://hostname/sharename/RomeoAndJuliet.pdf.
That would also be a URI, but more specifically a URL because it locates the text.
